# MuNeRF: Robust Makeup Transfer in Neural Radiance Fields

We present **MuNeRF**, a unified framework for Robust **M**ake**u**p Transfer in **Ne**ural **R**adiance **F**ields that is able to transfer makeup styles (left column) to facial images of different poses and expressions while preserving the geometry and appearance consistency.

<!-- ## Features 
- MuNeRF is the first universal unsupervised image segmentation model that can tackle unsupervised semantic-aware instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks using a unified framework.
- MuNeRF can learn unsupervised object detectors and instance segmentors solely on ImageNet-1K.
- MuNeRF exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts when evaluated on 11 different benchmarks across domains like natural images, video frames, paintings, sketches, etc.
- MuNeRF can serve as a pretrained model for fully/semi-supervised detection and segmentation tasks. -->
